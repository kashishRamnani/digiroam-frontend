RoamDigi is not responsible for any issues related to the PSP.\nAll prices listed exclude taxes unless otherwise specified. Taxes will be calculated based on your billing address at the time of purchase.\n\n**4.1 Payment Methods**\nRoamDigi provides a variety of payment options, such as Credit/Debit Cards, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Alipay. Payments are processed in US Dollars (USD) or other supported currencies, as determined during checkout.\nAll credit card transactions are securely handled by RoamDigi-approved payment processors, including but not limited to PayPal (https://paypal.com) and Stripe (https://stripe.com). RoamDigi may also use additional payment service providers to manage transactions.\n\n**4.2 Automatic Renewals for End Users**\nRoamDigi offers an auto-renewal feature for uninterrupted service, designed for End Users who want seamless connectivity.\n1. How It Works: Renewal fees are automatically charged to the user's selected payment method whenever their data usage nears depletion or at the start of each new billing cycle.\n2. Cancellation Policy: End Users can opt out of the auto-renewal feature anytime. Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, allowing the service to continue until that period ends. Changes can be made in your RoamDigi account settings or with help from customer support.\n\n**4.3 Billing and Invoices for Business Users**\nFor Business Users, RoamDigi employs a straightforward invoicing system to manage the use of RoamDigi Credits. These credits are used to purchase eSIMs, top-ups, and other services on the Partner Platform.\n1. Invoice Details: Each invoice outlines the credits used during the billing period, offering clear information on charges to help businesses monitor spending.\n2. Payment Deadlines: Business Users are expected to pay invoices by the due date mentioned. Prompt payment ensures uninterrupted access to services.\n3. Consequences of Late Payment:\n1. Services may be temporarily suspended if invoices are unpaid after the deadline.\n2. Interest may be charged on overdue amounts, and RoamDigi reserves the right to recover additional costs incurred due to late payments, such as legal or administrative fees.\nInvoices are generally issued in USD but may also be presented in other currencies based on agreements with the Business User.\n\n**4.4 Prepaid Transactions for Business Users**\nBusiness Users can purchase RoamDigi Credits upfront to buy eSIMs, top-ups, and other services.\n1. Purchasing Credits: Payments can be made via credit/debit cards, bank transfers, or other digital payment methods, depending on the user's preference.\n2. Using Credits: Once purchased, these credits can be used as needed to procure services, offering businesses flexibility to plan their spending in line with their operations.\nFor additional details, Business Users can visit the RoamDigi Partner Platform or contact support.\n\n**4.5 Postpaid Transactions for Business Users**\nFor added convenience, RoamDigi also provides a postpaid payment model that allows Business Users to access services first and pay later.\n1. How It Works: Business Users can obtain eSIMs, top-ups, or other services with the payment obligation deferred to a later date as outlined in the issued invoice.\n2. Credit Limits:\n1. A predefined credit limit may apply, allowing businesses to make purchases up to a certain amount.\n2. Credit limits may be set by RoamDigi or negotiated based on the terms of the agreement.\n3. Eligibility:\n1. Not all Business Users qualify for postpaid options. Eligibility depends on factors such as transaction history, creditworthiness, and the duration of the partnership with RoamDigi.\nThis postpaid system offers businesses the flexibility to focus on operations without the need for immediate financial settlement."
